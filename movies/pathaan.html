  <p>Principal photography for Pathaan began in November 2020 in Mumbai. The film was shot over various locations in India, Afghanistan, Spain, UAE, Turkey, Russia, Italy and France. Two songs were composed by the duo Vishal–Shekhar, while Sanchit Balhara and Ankit Balhara provided the score. The music video of one song, "Besharam Rang", featured Padukone in a saffron bikini, which led to protests by right-wing Hindutva groups who saw it as an insult and a call by them to boycott the film; however, the Central Board of Film Certification cleared the film for exhibition after certain edits were made to the song sequence. The film was made on an estimated production budget of ₹225 crore (US$28 million) with a further ₹15 crore (US$1.9 million) spent on print and advertising. Against the norm, pre-release publicity was limited with no media interactions or public events.

  
Pathaan was released in India on 25 January 2023, coinciding with the Republic Day weekend, in IMAX, 4DX and standard formats along with dubbed versions in Tamil and Telugu. It received positive reviews from critics and broke several Indian box-office records, including the biggest opening day and opening weekend for a Hindi film. Further opening records were set in overseas markets. Grossing ₹1,006.92 crore (US$130 million) worldwide, Pathaan ranks as the highest-grossing Indian film of 2023, the second-highest-grossing Hindi film worldwide and the fifth-highest-grossing Indian film of all time; it is currently the seventh highest grossing film of 2023 worldwide, as well as the highest-grossing of Khan's career and Yash Raj Films's releases.</p>
